### Kaizo Rules:
| Rule                        | Details
|-|-|
| Have Fun!üôÇ                 | This tournament has brought together a lot of streamers and their communities. It's all about having fun and enjoying the experience! |
| 10 Seeds Per Round          | Each player will complete 10 seeds within the week. |
| Make Time For Seeds         | 10 seeds must be completed in the 1 week window. If the seeds are not completed, the score will be considered final at the closing of the round. |
| Random Ball Choice          | The ball choice in the lab MUST be chosen through randomisation. Limeoatsbot has a great choice command (!pkmn choose) to randomly select a ball. You may also use other methods of random choices (E.g. a wheel spin, but must be shown). In no circumstances can the player only select one ball before seeing the choice or chat chooses the ball. |
| Choice Seeds (#5 & #10)     | Seeds #5 and #10 are an exception to the traditional Kaizo rules. You are allowed to CHOOSE your starter. For all other seeds, the starter MUST be chosen through randomisation. The ball choice has to be random. No Legendary or 600BST mons are allowed. |
| All Legends Lab             | If 3 Legendaries/600BST show up in the lab, still select a random ball, complete the Rival 1 battle and pivot before the first trainer. If it is a Choice Seed, pick which mon you would like to run in the lab and then pivot immediately after. |
| 2 Legends Lab               | Re-randomise the seed and DO NOT count it as a reset. We want people to have a chance! |
| 1 Legend Lab                | Randomly select a ball. If the selection is the Legend/600BST mon, you may choose the ball you would like to run but NOT the Legend/600BST. |
| Kaizo Luck Clause           | If you do not beat the first rival battle in ANY of your FIRST 9 attempts, you can repeat seed #10 as a Choice Seed until Rival 1 is cleared. This means you re-randomise the seed, not play the same seed over and over until you win it. |
| Trapping Rule               | Before the Rival 1 battle, if a mon traps you and 0 Pok√© Balls have been found, you may kill the mon. This CANNOT be exploited purposefully. If you picked up a Pok√© Ball, you MUST attempt to catch and release or pivot- your intentions must also be declared. If you catch and release, you may not look at the info for the Pok√©mon. If you are trapped while scouting and do not have any balls/run out of balls, you may kill the mon but DO NOT have to return and pivot. PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE THIS RULE. |
| Seed Visibility             | Please have a visible note somewhere on your stream layout which indicates the seed you are currently running. E.g. Tourney Seed #1 |
| Score Hand-In               | Upon completion of your stream, the player must post seed scores in the #Tourny-Score-Submit channel. Please use the correct format so admins can update the spreadsheet as fast as possible. |
| Tie Event                   | In the event of a tie, the player who had the furthest run will be declared the winner. Full clear bonus points ARE NOT milestones. If players are still tied, a 1-seed sudden death play-off will be completed to determine the winner. |

### Battle Royale Bracket:
| Rule                        | Details

| Win The Bracket             | The winner will have the highest score and earns their üèÜ |

### Global Bonus Points Rules (NEW):
| Rule                        | Details
|-|-|
| Level-Up Evolutions         | Successfully evolving a Pok√©mon through level-up (Stones/Friendship will not count) will earn you bonus points towards your tournament score. |
| <420BST = Double Points     | Running a Pok√©mon that is <420BST will net you (x2) DOUBLE points on milestones. Once it evolves (if it does), you will no longer have the x2 modifier. |
- Bonus structure: Lvl 0-19 (+2) -- Lvl 20-29 (+3) -- Lvl 30+ (+5)
- Rival 1 battle is ONLY worth 1 point, even though your BST might be lower than 420. If you evolve in the lab, you will get 1 point for the milestone and 2 points for the evo.
- Where it evolves MUST be reflected in your score reporting.
- Limited to two evolution bonuses PER SEED.
- Evolution targets (for bonus points) can ONLY come from the following locations: Route 29, 30, 31, 32, 46, Ruins of Alph, Dark Cave, Headbutt/Fishing locations pre-Union Cave.
-  Evolution bonus is not available to new pivots after Union Cave.
